# Sentinel2--Applications-to-Farming
In this project, we utilize Sentinel-2 satellite data and APIs to develop a Python-based tool for analyzing multispectral imagery. The goal is to address challenges faced by smallholder farmers and pastoralists by providing insights through data visualizations, such as graphs and maps, based on current and historical satellite imagery.
