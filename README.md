# Sentinel2--Applications-to-Farming
In this project, we utilize Sentinel-2 satellite data and APIs to develop a Python-based tool for analyzing multispectral imagery. The goal is to address challenges faced by smallholder farmers and pastoralists by providing insights through data visualizations, such as graphs and maps, based on current and historical satellite imagery. 
## Sentinel2 Data
The Sentinel2 Data Collection is an open source dataset of satellite images and other metrics which are collected from the Copernicus Sentinel missions, in partciular, this data comes from one sector of the Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem. The Copernicus Sentinel2 data is derived from two polar orbiting satellites, at the same sun-synchronous orbit, but with a phase offset of 18ยบ. The satellites revist the same location approximately in a 5 day phase, capturing new images. More about the Sentinel2 Dataset can be found on the following webpage: [Sentinel2-Resources](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/explore-data/data-collections/sentinel-data/sentinel-2)
