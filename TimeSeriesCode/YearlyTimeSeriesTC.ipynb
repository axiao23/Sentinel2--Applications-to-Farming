The complete workflow is shown below\n","---\n","\n","##  Mounting Google Drive\n","\n","The first step mounts a persons Google Drive to Colab to access and save files.

It is then converted into a numpy array to access pixel data. The image is reshaped so that each row corresponds to one pixel, and each column holds its Red, Green, and Blue values. These values are saved into a CSV file in the format:\n","\n","####Pixel Number | Red | Green | Blue\n","\n","\n","This step helps test the code on one file before applying it to all within a time frame.\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Batch Convert All Images to RGB CSVs\n","\n","The notebook loops through all `.png` images in the directory and automates the RGB extraction:\n","\n","- **Extracts the date** from each imageâ€™s filename using a common format.\n","- **Loads the image**, reshapes it into RGB format.\n","- **Saves a new CSV file** for each image using the same corresponding date (e.g., `20190802.csv`).\n","\n","All CSVs are stored in: /TrueColorcsvs/\n","\n","\n","---\n","\n","##  Merge All CSVs & Calculate Average RGB Values\n","\n","All CSVs are loaded into pandas (pd) dataframes and merged into one dataset using the pixel number as a common key. The script then calculates the **mean Red, Green, and Blue values** for each pixel across all dates using `.groupby()` and `.agg('mean')`.\n","\n","The result is saved to a new CSV file: `average_rgb_by_pixel.csv`\n","\n","\n","This provides an average color per pixel over time.\n","\n","---\n","\n","## Filter Out Cloud-Covered Pixels\n","\n","This is an assumption that clouds in satellite images typically show up as white (RGB = 255, 255, 255).
